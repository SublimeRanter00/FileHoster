## Local File Hoster
- This code was created as a simple project to quickly transfer files from my phone to my PC via the local network before **Link to Windows** became a thing.
- It is an extremely WIP project with basically zero stress testing or bug testing as it is intended only for personal use in a local network.
- It is also very useful to transfer things from Apple environment to your PC
### Requirements:
- Node JS
- All files required by Node JS
- All devices connected to the same local network

#### Port to access the server by default is 3000!
